## How to Build an AWS ECS Cluster with Terraform and Nginx Container Image?

👉🏻👉🏼👉🏽👉🏾👉🏿 [Link to Tutorial](https://marc.it/how-to-create-an-ecs-cluster-using-terraform/)

The project described uses Terraform, a cloud-agnostic Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, to provision and manage resources in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The project also utilizes Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) to orchestrate and manage Docker containers, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store and distribute Docker images. Additionally, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is used to isolate and secure the resources, while Amazon Route 53 is used for DNS management. Finally, Amazon CloudWatch and CloudTrail are used for logging and monitoring, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is used to manage access and permissions to resources.

### What does Amazon ECS stand for and how does it work?

Amazon ECS is a container management service offered by AWS that provides a scalable and efficient way to run and manage containerized applications. With ECS, users can easily deploy and manage Docker containers on a cluster of virtual machines, allowing them to quickly scale and manage their applications as needed. Additionally, ECS offers a number of advanced features, such as load balancing, auto-scaling, and task scheduling, making it an ideal choice for large-scale container deployments.

### How does Terraform work and what are its key features?

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool designed by HashiCorp that enables users to define and manage their infrastructure through declarative configuration files. By using Terraform, users can easily build, provision, and modify cloud-based resources such as virtual machines, load balancers, and databases in a repeatable and scalable way. The tool is cloud-agnostic, meaning it can be used with multiple cloud providers and services, and offers a wide range of advanced features such as resource graph visualization, automated plan approval, and dependency management.
